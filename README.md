# FinalRound_SandBox_Demiurge
## Major project for Final Year (2018): A web browser based on JavaFX, which implements the sandbox property!!

The elaborate description will follow, but some key points before that:<br />
1. The sandboxing feature for downloads works in Linux version, hence the windows version is simply a web browser thing.<br />
2. There are 2 branches currently (25-06-2019 1004 hrs): <br />
	- master<br />
	- branch_LINUX_department<br />
	The LINUX branch is the branch containing all the important and up-to-date code, as is dedicated totally for Linux.
  So, if you wanna checkout a branch, this is the branch to look forward to, and **not** the master.
